Docker registry search functionality v2 is not supported at the time of this writing. See discussion since Feb 2015: https://github.com/docker/distribution/issues/206

Registry V2 is like dropping images into a black bag, hope you remember what you dropped in and what you named the image. Don't even think about deleting an image. I do not want to rip and replace V2 with V1; even though V1 works and has several tools that work with V1 including search and delete. I started with registry V2 from the marketing; better security and performance.

Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS, CoreOS 723.3.0 registry github.com/docker/distribution v2.1.1

I wrote a script, named view-private-registry to search registry V2 REGISTRY_STORAGE_FILESYSTEM_ROOTDIRECTORY. It works on any of my systems that has the REGISTRY_STORAGE_FILESYSTEM_ROOTDIRECTORY mounted. Let me know of any changes you would make, thanks.

Script:

#!/bin/bash
# %W% %G% %U%
#
#       View private registry,
#               if REGISTRY_STORAGE_FILESYSTEM_ROOTDIRECTORY is mounted on your system
#
REGISTRY_STORAGE_FILESYSTEM_ROOTDIRECTORY="/mnt/three/docker-registry/registry-data"
#
find $REGISTRY_STORAGE_FILESYSTEM_ROOTDIRECTORY -print | \
    grep 'v2/repositories' | \
    grep 'current' | \
    grep -v 'link' | \
    sed -e 's/\/_manifests\/tags\//:/' | \
    sed -e 's/\/current//' | \
    sed -e 's/^.*repositories\//    /' | \
    sort > /tmp/a1
cat /tmp/a1
wc -l /tmp/a1 > /tmp/a2
echo "Number of images: `cat /tmp/a2 | awk {'print $1'}`"
echo "Disk space used:  `du -hs $REGISTRY_STORAGE_FILESYSTEM_ROOTDIRECTORY`"
rm /tmp/a1 /tmp/a2`

Output:

`$ ./view-private-registry`
